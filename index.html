    <p style="text-align:center;font-family:'verdana'">
      The film industry is incredibly diverse and caters to a wide audience.  This ranges from small, indie films to massive
      blockbusters that gross millions of dollars.  We were interested to see any kind of relationship that exists between a 
      film's rating score and its genre. We have gathered an extensive set of information from the IMDB website in an attempt
      to understand two main questions:
    </p>

    <div style="text-align:left;font-family:'verdana'">
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>1.</strong> What types of films are popular to the general public?<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>2.</strong> Which genre of film are movie reviewers, both casual and professional, drawn to or favor?
    </p><br>
    
    <p style="text-align:left;font-family:'verdana'">
      We began by taking a look at total number of films found on IMDB and grouped them together based on which genre they
      were most associated with.  This gave us an idea of which films the public tend to be attracted to.  This goes off the
      assumption that film companies produce movies that they predict will perform well.  We then ordered the genres from
      largest to smallest.
      We then asked ourselves the question 'How does the popularity of each genre compare to the number of reviews published
      for a certain genre?'.  To answer this, we aggregated each movie within a certain genre, like we did previously, and
      then calculated amount of reviews each film got within that genre.  We then averaged those out to a single number and
      plotted the results.  This demonstrates which genre reviewers leaned towards more.

      Lastly, we took a look at how this persisted over the last century.  This begins around 1930, when film started to
      become mainstream across the United States, until the present.  Each color represents a different genre of film
      and how its trend changed over the years.
